She played a college freshman, Eun Yeong-ro, who is held hostage by her love interest. It garnered relatively low ratings due to controversy surrounding allegations of historical distortion, which prompted a review by the Korea Communications Standards Commission.The investigation concluded that the content of the drama could not be viewed as a distortion of history. The show ranked number one on Disney+ in four out of the five countries it was made available in, including South Korea.

                                Lalisa Manobal (also spelled Manoban; born Pranpriya Manobal, March 27, 1997), known mononymously as Lisa, is a Thai rapper, singer and dancer based in South Korea. She is a member of the South Korean girl group Blackpink formed by YG Entertainment.<br>
                                Lisa made her solo debut with her single album Lalisa in September 2021. The album sold over 736,000 copies in its release week in South Korea, making her the first female artist to do so. The music video for its lead single of the same name recorded 73.6 million views on YouTube in first 24 hours of its release, becoming the most-viewed music video in the first 24 hours on the platform by a solo artist.

                                Born as Pranpriya Manobal on March 27, 1997 in Buriram Province, Thailand, she later legally changed her name to Lalisa, meaning the one being praised, on the advice of a fortune teller in order to bring in prosperity. As an only child, she was raised by her Thai mother and Swiss stepfather. Lisa's mother is named Chitthip Brüschweiler. Her stepfather is Marco Brüschweiler, a renowned chef, currently active in Thailand. Lisa completed secondary education at Praphamontree School I and II.<br>
                                In 2010, 13-year-old Lisa auditioned to join South Korean record label YG Entertainment in Thailand. From a young age, Lisa gained an interest in K-pop idols, namely admiring artists Big Bang and 2NE1, and wished to someday follow a similar path. Among the 4,000 applicants, she was the only individual to qualify, which prompted then CEO, Yang Hyun-suk into offering Lisa a chance to become a YG Entertainment trainee. Lisa also impressed one of the judges, Danny Im of 1TYM, at the auditions, with him later praising her on-stage confidence and her off-stage attitude.

                                Jennie Kim was born in Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul on January 16, 1996, as an only child. She initially attended Cheongdam Elementary School in Seoul before moving to New Zealand. When she was eight years old, she went on a trip with her family to Australia and New Zealand. When her mother asked her if she liked New Zealand and wanted to stay, Jennie replied "yes"; one year later, she was sent to study at Waikowhai Intermediate School in Auckland and lived with a home-stay family. Jennie spoke about her experience learning a new language on the MBC's documentary English, Must Change to Survive (2006). During her adolescent years, she dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer. After completing intermediate, she enrolled at ACG Parnell College.

                                Roseanne Park (Korean: 박채영; Park Chae-young) was born on 11 February 1997 in Auckland, New Zealand, to South Korean immigrant parents. She has an older sister. In 2004, at the age of seven, Rosé and her family moved to Melbourne, Australia. She attended Kew East Primary School, graduating in 2009, and completed secondary education at Canterbury Girls' Secondary College in Melbourne, studying law. She began singing and learned to play guitar and piano as a child and performed in church choirs.<br>
                                In 2012, at age 15, Rosé attended an audition in Sydney, Australia for South Korean record label YG Entertainment at her father's suggestion, ranking first among 700 participants. She enjoyed the label's music greatly, citing they had all the "cool" groups. Within two months, Rosé dropped out of school, signed with the label as a trainee, and moved to Seoul, South Korea. She initially presumed her father's idea was a joke due to the distance and difficulty of becoming a singer overseas<br>
                                The same year, Rosé was given an opportunity to feature on labelmate G-Dragon's song "Without You" from his extended play (EP) One of a Kind (2012). Her name was not publicised at the time of release, her credit revealed only following her announcement as a member of Blackpink. The song peaked at number ten on South Korea's Gaon Music Chart and at number 15 on the Billboard Korea K-pop Hot 100.

                                Rosé trained at YG Entertainment for four years before she was revealed as the final member of the girl group Blackpink on 22 June 2016. The group debuted on 8 August 2016 with the single album Square One, which featured the singles "Whistle" and "Boombayah".<br>
                                Rosé appeared on a variety of broadcast programs, such as King of Masked Singer. Her vocal performance on the show was met with warm reception by the audience, to which Rosé commented that she "didn't know if the audience would like [her] singing" and that she felt "happy and relieved" at the positive result.
